# Reading device state

## A one-off snapshot

For a quick look at everything at once, `collect_device_snapshot` gathers the
individual endpoints concurrently and tolerates partial failures:

```python
from busylib.features import collect_device_snapshot

snapshot = await collect_device_snapshot(client)
print(f"Name: {snapshot.name or 'unknown'}")
print(f"Battery: {snapshot.power.battery_charge if snapshot.power else 'unknown'}")
print(f"Wi-Fi: {snapshot.wifi.state if snapshot.wifi else 'unknown'}")
print(f"Field errors: {snapshot.field_errors}")
```

**Example output:**

```
Name: Front desk
Battery: 88
Wi-Fi: connected
Field errors: {}
```

`{}` means every snapshot endpoint responded. A non-empty `field_errors`
dictionary identifies only the unavailable fields, while usable values remain
available in the same snapshot.

A field that fails lands in `field_errors` instead of aborting the whole
snapshot, so one unavailable endpoint doesn't cost you the rest.

The underlying calls are available individually too: `version()`, `status()`,
`display_brightness()`, `audio_volume()`, `wifi_status()`, `ble_status()`,
`storage_status()`, `time()`, `name()`.

## Streaming updates

`/api/status/ws` pushes protobuf state messages as things change, which is far
better than polling:

```python
async for message in client.stream_status_ws():
    if isinstance(message, dict):
        print(message)
```

**Example output after a power update:**

```
{'updates': [{'power': {'known': {'battery_charge_percent': 88}}}]}
```

The exact payload changes with the device event. Each member of `updates` is a
delta, not a full device snapshot, so retain earlier state for fields absent
from that message.

Messages are decoded from the `BSB_State.State` schema into dictionaries with
the original proto field names. Each one carries a list of `updates`, where
every entry is one changed thing: `device_name`, `power`, `brightness`,
`audio_volume`, `wifi`, `timezone`, `ble`, `update_state`, `input`, `timer`, or
`frame`.

## Keeping a snapshot in sync

`DeviceStateStore` applies those deltas onto a snapshot for you and notifies
subscribers:

```python
from busylib.features import DeviceStateStore, collect_device_snapshot

store = DeviceStateStore(await collect_device_snapshot(client))
store.on_state(lambda snapshot: print("now:", snapshot.name))
store.on_diff(lambda changed, snapshot: print("changed:", changed))

async for message in client.stream_status_ws():
    if isinstance(message, dict):
        store.apply_stream_message(message)
```

**Example output after a battery update:**

```
now: Front desk
changed: {'power'}
```

The first callback receives the complete merged snapshot; the second names the
top-level fields changed by this particular stream message.

`on_state` receives the full updated snapshot; `on_diff` also receives the set
of top-level fields that actually changed, which is handy for redrawing only
what moved.

## Screen frames arrive here too

Current firmware has no separate screen WebSocket. Instead, front-display
frames come through this same stream as `frame` updates, carrying their own
`width`, `height`, `encoding`, and `pixel_format`. The store decodes them into
`Frame` objects on `DeviceSnapshot.screen_front` and `screen_back`:

```python
def on_diff(changed, snapshot):
    if "screen_front" in changed and snapshot.screen_front is not None:
        render(snapshot.screen_front)


store.on_diff(on_diff)
```

**Expected result:** `render` receives a decoded `Frame` whenever the front
screen changes, carrying RGB bytes with their geometry. This fragment intentionally has no terminal output; the
observable result is the updated image in your renderer.

Because the frame describes its own encoding, no guessing by payload size is
involved — see `busylib.display.decode_frame_data`. A decoded frame whose size
doesn't match the target display is logged and dropped rather than stored, so a
malformed update can't reach a renderer.

## What an update leaves out

proto3 omits any field holding its type's default, so an update the BUSY Bar did
send can be missing the very thing it is about. Two of those bite:

- a number that is absent means zero - a muted volume, an unplugged USB, a
  panel at its dimmest;
- `battery_status` absent means `DISCHARGING`, because that is the first
  value of the firmware's enum. A BUSY Bar simply running on its battery reports
  the most common state of all as nothing at all.

`apply_state_stream_update` reads both the way the device means them. What it
cannot do is tell you whether a cable is plugged in: the firmware knows
(`vbus_present` internally) but does not put it on the wire, and `usb_voltage`
reads non-zero on a BUSY Bar that is discharging with nothing attached.

## Buttons, the selector and the wheel

Physical input arrives on the same stream, as `input` updates.
`input_events()` turns one state message into the events it carried, so a
consumer reacts to a press rather than to a nested dictionary of the
firmware's enum names:

```python
from busylib.features import input_events
from busylib.features.input_events import ButtonEvent, EncoderEvent, SelectorEvent

async for message in bb.stream_status_ws():
    for event in input_events(message):
        match event:
            case ButtonEvent(button="ok") if event.is_press:
                confirm()
            case SelectorEvent(position=position):
                print(f"selector moved to {position}")
            case EncoderEvent(delta=delta):
                scroll(delta)
```

Both press and release events are reported, so a long press is distinguishable from
a short one; `is_press` is there because most callers only want one of them.

Two things worth knowing. The BUSY Bar reports the selector **only when it moves** -
there’s no way to ask "where is it now" - so its position is unknown until the first
move after you start listening. And the same events come back when input is
sent with `input()`, because the firmware makes no distinction between a
button pressed by a finger and one pressed over HTTP:

```python
await bb.input("ok")  # a key by name, or types.InputKey.OK
```
